  --av-class
  There are 13 av classes: caoliu_west_reposted, caoliu_cartoon_reposted, caoliu_asia_mosaicked_reposted, caoliu_asia_non_mosaicked_reposted, caoliu_west_original, caoliu_cartoon_original, caoliu_asia_mosaicked_original, caoliu_asia_non_mosaicked_original, caoliu_selfie, aicheng_west, aicheng_cartoon, aicheng_asia_mosaicked and aicheng_asia_non_mosaicked. 
  As the name implies, "caoliu" stands for CaoLiu forum, "aicheng" for AiCheng forum, "reposted" and "original" are clearity, and the "selfie" is photos by oneself, you konw which one is your best lover (yes, only one). 
  The default is aicheng_asia_mosaicked. 

  --concurrent-tasks
  You can set more than one proxy, each proxy could more than one concurrent tasks. This option set the number of concurrent tasks of each prox. 
  The default number is 8. 

  --timeout-download-picture
  Some pictures too big to download in few seconds. So, you should set the download picture timeout seconds. 
  The default timeout is 16 seconds.

  --topics-range
  Set the range of to download topics. E.G.: 
    --topics-range 2 16
    --topics-range 8 (I.E., --topics-range 1 8)
    --topics-range -1 (I.E., all topics of this av class)
  The default topics range is 1 to 64. 

  --saveas-path
  Set the path to save seeds and pictures. The rule of dir: [avclass][range]@hhmmss. E.G., [aicheng_west][2~32]@124908/. 
  The default directory is home directory (or windows is C:\). 

  --hate
  If you hate some subject topics, you can ignore them by setting this option with keywords in topic title, split by space-char ' ', and case sensitive. E.G., --hate Â≠ïÂ¶á ÈáçÂè£Âë≥. When --hate keywords list conflict with --like, --hate first. 

  --like
  If you like some subject topics, you can grab them by setting this option with keywords in topic title, split by space-char ' ', and case sensitive. E.G., --like Ëãç‰∫ïÁ©∫ Â∞èÊ≥ΩÁéõÂà©‰∫ö. When --like keywords list conflict with --hate, --hate first. 

  --proxy
  As you know, the government likes blocking adult websites, so, I do suggest you to set --proxy option. Hardseed supports more proxys: 
    a) GoAgent (STRONGLY recommended), --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8087
    b) shadowsocks, --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080, or socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080
    c) SSH, --proxy socks4://127.0.0.1:7070
    d) VPN (PPTP and openVPN), --proxy ""
  It is important that you should know, you can set more proxys at the same time, split by space-char ' '. As the --concurrent-tasks option says, each proxy could more than one concurrent tasks, now, what about more proxys? Yes, yes, the speed of downloading seed and pictures is very very fast. E.G., --concurrent-tasks 8 --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8087 socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 socks4://127.0.0.1:7070, the number of concurrent tasks is 8*3. 
  If you wanna how to install and configure various kinds of proxy, please access my homepage "3.2 Êê≠Ê¢ØÁøªÂ¢ô" https://github.com/yangyangwithgnu/the_new_world_linux#3.2 
  If you are not good at computer, there is a newest goagent for floks who are not good at computer by me, yes, out of box. see https://github.com/yangyangwithgnu/goagent_out_of_box_yang   The default http://127.0.0.1:8087. 

  That's all. Any suggestions let me know by [1m[32myangyangwithgnu@yeah.net[0m or [1m[32mhttp://yangyangwithgnu.github.io/[0m, big thanks to you. Kiddo, take care of your body. :-)
